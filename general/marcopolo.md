Create an algorithm that will replicate the call-Out game of Marco Polo.
In the updated version, we count 1-100
But
1. when you get to a number divisible by 3, you print "Marco"
2. when you get to a number divisible by 5 you print "Polo"
3. when you get to a number that is divisible by both 3 and 5 you should print "MarcoPolo"

Success steps:
1. You can print 1-100 as below:

    `1

     2

     3

     4

     5

     6

     7

     8

     9

     10`


2. You can print "Marco" at places where the number is divisible by 3 as below:

    `1

     2

     Marco

     4

     5

     Marco

     7

     8

     Marco

     10`

3. You can print "Polo" where the number is divisble by 5 as below:

    `1

     2

     3

     4

     Polo

     6

     7

     8

     9

     Polo

     11`

4. You can print "MarcoPolo" where the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 as below:

    `1

     2

     3

     4

     5

     6

     7
