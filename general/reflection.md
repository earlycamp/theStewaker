Given a string, write a python function to check if the reverse of the string is the same as string. 

For example, `“radar”` is reflected becasuse it can be read in reverse and will still be `"radar"`, but `“radiator”` is not reflected.

Examples: 
 
* example 1
    Input : `radar`

    Output : `Yes`

* example 2

    Input : `frank`

    Output : `No`
