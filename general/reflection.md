Given a string, write a python function to check if the reverse of the string is the same as string. 

For example, `“radar”` is reflected becasuse it can be read in reverse and will still be `"radar"`, but `“radiator”` is not reflected.

Examples: 
 

`Input : radar
Output : Yes

Input : frank
Output : No`
