Given two sorted integer arrays array1 and array2, merge merge them to create one sorted array, array3.

Note:

    The number of elements initialized in array1 and array2 are m and n respectively.
    
   

Example 1:
    
    Input:
    array1 = [1,2,3,7,4,9], 
    array2 = [2,5,6],       
    
    Output: 
     array3= [1,2,2,3,,4,5,6,7,9]
     
     
Example 2:
    
    Input:
    array1 = [5,2,8,7,4,9], 
    array2 = [9,6],       
    
    Output: 
     array3= [2,4,5,6,7,8,9,9]
